### 👋 Hi there!

🎓 I'm Chloe (she/her), a first-year student in the accelerated Bachelor of Computer Science (BCS) program at UBC. I am passionate about building meaningful products and connections and bring an upbeat drive to succeed.

💪 With a background as a Pharmacist and Cosmetic Tattoo Artist, I have honed my skills in problem-solving, interdisciplinary collaboration, leadership, and adaptability. I also possess a deep sense of empathy, which allows me to bring unique perspectives from the users' and patients' journeys.

🏢 Currently, I serve as the President of the BCS Student Association, leading initiatives to support the BCS community through social and professional development events. I ran for this position in my first year, eager to embrace challenges and learn. I am committed to expanding my knowledge and skills and am comfortable putting myself in uncomfortable situations to grow. 

💻 In summary: I'm eager to learn, take on challenges, and make meaningful impacts that help others!

💫 Let's connect!
